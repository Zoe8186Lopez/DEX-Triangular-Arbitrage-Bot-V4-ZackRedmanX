       Here little of a explanation for those who don't understand what triangular arbitrage is:
       Triangular arbitrage, a popular trading strategy in the world of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEX), has gained significant attention among crypto traders and investors. This strategy involves exploiting price inconsistencies between three different cryptocurrencies to generate risk-free profits. In this article, we will delve into the concept of triangular arbitrage in the context of DEX, understanding its mechanics, challenges, and potential opportunities for crypto traders.
        Understanding Triangular Arbitrage in DEX:
        Triangular arbitrage in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges operates on the same principle as in traditional markets, with the key difference being the absence of intermediaries or centralized authorities. DEX platforms allow traders to execute trades directly from their wallets, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. Triangular arbitrage in DEX involves taking advantage of price disparities between three cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange to yield profits.
